# doedupsort

O(N) implementation to solve deduplication and sorting problem

Problem Description:

Sorting and deduplication are the basis in data compression and
optimization. Now there are N big numbers between 0 and 9999999999 generated
by computer randomly, where n <= 500000. Your task is to get rid of repeated
numbers, and sort them.  (The judge system is a 32-bit system with memory
limit of <=512M.)
